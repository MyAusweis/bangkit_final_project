# JKT6B Final Project for Bangkit Led By Google
# Dataset address is : https://github.com/agusekominarno/Batik
#
# We have no Batik name for each class, therefore we show dissimilarity between images given and images from our database
 Batik-group is the folder that we created manually for training using inception_v3 and mobilenet_v2
 Batik-inception_v3.ipynb is we try to implement transfer learning using inception_v3
 Batik-mobilenet_v2.ipynb is we try to implement transfer learning using mobilenet_v2

 Batik300 is the folder for Batik-Siamese-4_2.ipynb and Batik-Siamese-5_1.ipynb
 Batik-Siamese-4_2.ipynb is recognize batik with 4 images for train and 2 for test
 Batik-Siamese-5_1.ipynb is recognize batik with 5 images for train and 1 for test

 you can implement or using this technique for small dataset that has a high similarity like images in the Batik300's 
 
 PNG file contains the report of training and testing
